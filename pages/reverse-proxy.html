<h3>Reverse Proxy</h3>
<p>
  A dedicated app-server can handle <em>more</em> requests but ultimately still has physical limits.
  Generally, the more concurrent requests a server has the slower <em>each</em> request will be.
</p>

<p>
  If one app-server can handle 1,000 requests, then two app-servers can handle 2,000 requests.
  It's possible to add additional app-servers to share the request load.
</p>

<p>
  To do this we first need to add a <strong>reverse-proxy server</strong> that can delegate or <em>proxy</em> the requests across multiple app-servers.
</p>

<p>
  The reverse-proxy is inserted <em>before</em> our app-server so requests go directly to the reverse-proxy.
  The reverse-proxy runs its own web-server software but it is configured to route requests to <em>other servers</em>.
